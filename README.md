# project-super-conjecture
a hobbyism project to learn and utilize server management tools to combine an arbitrary amount of computers into one

Hello World!
We will take computers and use Kubernetes and Docker to combine them into one supercomputer. NixOS will be the operating system we use, as the computers will be dualbooted with Windows so they can be used normally by sweaty gamer nerds. NixOS will be on GitHub and we will then push to each computer to make updates to the OS. Then some magic happens and it's set up for use. The end goal is to be able to make the supercomputer run our blender renders, end-game Stellaris saves, and do protein-folding in the spare time. It's gonna be great! :)
